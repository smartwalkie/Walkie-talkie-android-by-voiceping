See those mic buttons?

Yup, that button is the only thing you need to add to your app to have PTT functionality.

But what if you don't want a mic button but another UI instead?

We have got it covered. You can customize it.


## Integrate walkie talkie sdk to your app

Build it with Android Studio and test on your device.

What you will need to integrate to your code is only 5 lines below.



1. Connect to the VoicePing server.
```
VoicePing.init(appContext, ‚ÄúVP_ROUTER_URL‚Äù, "COMPANY_NAME")
VoicePing.connect(‚ÄúUSER ID‚Äù, callback)
```



2. Now join the clients to the same channel (group), then they can talk to each other.
```
VoicePing.joinGroup(‚ÄúGROUP_ID‚Äù, callback)
```



3. To start and stop the PTT (which you can then hook with user events like click and release or something else):
```
VoicePing.startTalking(context, ‚ÄúGROUP_ID‚Äù)
VoicePing.stopTalking(context)
```



## Customization

You can customize the size, color, of the mic button.
You can also customize the shape of the mic button. Or you can have your own PTT button.

```
<com.smartwalkie.voicepingsdk.VoicePingButton
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:shape="..." (oval / rectangle)
    app:radius="..."
    app:backgroundColor="..."
    app:micColor="..."
    />
```

## VoicePing server URL

VoicePing Android SDK needs a VoicePing server to work. You can test with our hosted server or you can have your own self hosted server later. You can look at this repo (coming soon: open source Router URL) to know how to self-host the server.

The public server URL: `wss://router-lite.voiceping.net`


## Self-hosted server

If you need to self-hosted the server, you can find more documentation on the server repo: 
* [voiceover-server](https://github.com/SmartWalkieOrg/voiceover-server) (This is the repo server, uses VoicePing.js)
* [VoicePing.js](https://github.com/SmartWalkieOrg/VoicePing.js) (This is the library)

## Maintainers
* [VoicePing team](https://www.voicepingapp.com/)

## VoicePing Enterprise


VoicePing Enterprise is the full featured closed source version with support. More features available are [https://www.voicepingapp.com](https://www.voicepingapp.com). You can try VoicePing on:

* [VoicePing iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voiceping/id1249953303?ls=1&mt=8)
