## How simple is it to add VoicePing SDK to your app?

<center><a href="https://www.voicepingapp.com" target="_blank"><img alt="SDK in your app" src="https://i.ibb.co/jzbbcbx/Group-4-1.png" title="This is a sample how the SDK will look like in your app" /></a></center>

See those mic buttons?

Yup, that button is the only thing you need to add to your app to have PTT functionality.

But what if you don't want a mic button but another UI instead?

We have got it covered. You can customize it.


## How to use VoicePing Android SDK

1. Initialize

Initialize VoicePing in your Application code, inside onCreate method

```kotlin
class VoicePingClientApp : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        VoicePing.init(this, "voiceping_sdk_server_url")
    }
}
```
  
  
2. Connect

Before you can start talking, you need connect to server. You can do that by call connect
method from VoicePing instance.

```kotlin
VoicePing.connect("your_user_id", "your_company", object : ConnectCallback {
    override fun onConnected() {
        // Do something
    }

    override fun onFailed(exception: VoicePingException) {
        // Do something
    }
})
```
  
  
3. Start Talking

After successfully connected, you can now start talking. You can start talking to individual
receiver using:

```kotlin
VoicePing.startTalking("receiver_id", ChannelType.PRIVATE, this)
```

or in a group using:

```kotlin
VoicePing.startTalking("group_id", ChannelType.GROUP, this)
```  
Before you can talk in a group, you need to join a group first, please look at item 6 below.
  
  
4. Stop Talking

To stop talking, for both Private and Group PTT:

```kotlin
VoicePing.stopTalking()
```
  
  
5. Disconnect

You can disconnect to stop receiving PTT:  

```kotlin
VoicePing.disconnect(object : DisconnectCallback {
    override fun onDisconnected() {
        // Do something
    }
})
```
  
  
6. Join a group

You cannot listen to a group channel before joining it. To join a group channel:

```kotlin
VoicePing.joinGroup("group_id")
```
  
  
7. Leave a group

To leave a group channel:

```kotlin
VoicePing.leaveGroup("group_id")
```
  
  
8. Mute specific channel

To mute specific channel:

```kotlin
VoicePing.mute("target_id", ChannelType.PRIVATE)
// or ChannelType.GROUP if you want to target group
```
  
  
9. Unmute specific channel

To unmute specific channel:

```kotlin
VoicePing.unmute("target_id", ChannelType.PRIVATE)
// or ChannelType.GROUP if you want to target group
```


## Customization

You can customize the size, color, of the mic button.
You can also customize the shape of the mic button. Or you can have your own PTT button.

```
<com.smartwalkie.voicepingsdk.VoicePingButton
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:shape="..." (oval / rectangle)
    app:radius="..."
    app:backgroundColor="..."
    app:micColor="..."
    />
```

## VoicePing server URL

VoicePing Android SDK needs a VoicePing server to work. You can test with our hosted server or you can have your own self hosted server later. You can look [at this repo](https://github.com/SmartWalkieOrg/walkie-talkie-server) to know how to self-host the server.

The public server URL: `wss://router-lite.voiceping.info`


## Self-hosted server

If you need to self-host the server, you can find more documentation on the server repo: 
* [voiceover-server](https://github.com/SmartWalkieOrg/voiceover-server) (This is the repo server, uses VoicePing.js)
* [VoicePing.js](https://github.com/SmartWalkieOrg/VoicePing.js) (This is the library)


## Maintainers

* [VoicePing team](https://www.voicepingapp.com/)
